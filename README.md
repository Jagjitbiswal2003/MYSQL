# MySQL Query Practice

This repository contains a curated set of **MySQL / SQL queries** that I have written to sharpen my database skills, particularly for placement preparation and technical interviews.

- **Basic SQL queries**: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  
- **Joins & subqueries**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, nested subqueries  
- **Aggregation**: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`  
- **Data Manipulation & Filtering**: `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`  
- **Advanced SQL** (if applicable): complex subqueries, window functions, etc.
